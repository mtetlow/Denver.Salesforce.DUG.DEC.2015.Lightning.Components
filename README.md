### Lightning Components
This is an example repo of two lightning components and one event. The two components communicate using the event and refresh their own data when a change is detected. 

This also demonstrates some error handling challenges with lightning components -> apex communications. We also demonstrate possible impacts of being able to mutate the DOM outside of a published component.
